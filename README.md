# Shorty Landing Page üõ†Ô∏è
This is the solution to the Shorted link page challenge called Shorty. The Frontend Mentor challenge helped me improve my coding skills by building a realistic project.

## The Challenge
My task is to build the project on the Front End. I will create mobile and desktop versions 

The designs are in static JPG format. This means I will have to use your best judgment for styles such as font size, padding, and margins. This will help train my eye to see differences in spacing and size.
